        Personal Information <hr />
        <p>I am Rishi Sarup, Currently I am 18 Years old and am a first year RMIT student. Prior I have completed VCE at a school in the South Western area of Melbourne. In my free time I enjoy playing sport or reading.
          An eventful thing that happened is that I was in a sporting tournament a while back and I managed to miss one of the final games because I went to go get something to eat and the team lost while I was gone.
