        Personal Information <hr />
        <p>I am Rishi Sarup, Currently I am 18 Years old and am a first year RMIT student. Prior I have completed VCE at a school in the South Western area of Melbourne. In my free time I enjoy playing sport or reading.
          An eventful thing that happened is that I was in a sporting tournament a while back and I managed to miss one of the final games because I went to go get something to eat and the team lost while I was gone.

      Interest in IT <hr />
      <p> I have an interest in IT because it is a field of work in which job growth is high and I know people who are in related job who have described their typical duties. 
        Due to this I have had the interest for a couple of years and have settled on IT. 
        Nothing in particular had caused me to create this interest and I do not have extensive IT experience, although I have had experience with friends of mine who are working in the IT/computer field as well as electrical. 
        Through interacting with them I have learnt some things. I had chosen to come to RMIT because of the reputation the University has with its IT and Engineering courses, 
        along with assessing this in regard to other Universities and this has been the one to work out best with multiple factors I had to think about. 
        Within my course I expect to learn and study about the software and hardware aspects of the field, as well as being able to get practical experience and mentoring in order to best prepare us students to be working 
        in the real jobs we are learning content for.
      </p>
      Ideal Job <hr />
      <p>
The position that I have picked as my Ideal Job is a position that is a 18-month graduate program that is designed to provide the graduates with the ability to learn different areas of IT and find out their strengths and 
        weaknesses to further push them forward to excel their careers. This is appealing to me as it is a graduate position for straight after University finishes, and it is able to provide a large amount of experience 
        towards me as an employee to further gain knowledge that can be used to be a more desirable candidate for other jobs. The qualifications that are expected are a degree, discipline or major in Computer Science, 
        Information Technology, Business Information Systems/Management and Information Systems/Technology, and this degree must have been completed in the last three years from July 2021. Further from this, they must be 
        an Australian or New Zealand Citizen, or New Zealand Permanent resident. Finally, the requirement is that the candidates are able to virtually attend key assessment days and be eligible/able to work starting from 
        July 2021. Currently for me I am just an Australian Citizen and although I do not have any experience or qualifications for the job, once completion of my course is complete within the date of the next 
        program, I will be eligible. Well for the position I will just make sure to have my degree completed in the right time prior to the commencement of the program and I will ensure I have the availability 
        to attend the key dates for assessment.

      Personal Profile <hr />
      In my results with the Myer-Briggs test I had gotten from 'www.16personalities.com' I have received the result of a Mediator (INFP-T). These results suggest that I am Introverted, intuitive, feeling and prospecting, it 
      states that with my caring nature I am able to sustain strong relationships with loved ones and despite seeming shy I have a robust and passionate inner life. Its further states that I am proud and act with the best intentions 
      although if people do not share my views, I may feel discouraged, also it is said that I make an effort to understand other emotions and I daydream often about rather than taking action and it will leave me unfulfilled. 
      Finally, it depicts that I will find myself aimless and stuck if I do not get myself a purpose for my life. 

      Overall, these are very in tune with myself although I am not as introverted as I will put myself out there at times if I have to. In relations to my strengths and weaknesses, I resonate with the strengths although for the 
      weaknesses I am not Emotionally driven and will not be set following my emotions rather than the facts of something.
      When working in a team I think it will affect my behaviour by me being very open to others ideas and inputs while providing my own point of view, although I could avoid conflict within the group I will still provide my input to 
      ensure the best ideas with everyone is taken on board. When forming a team I believe that it must be taken into account that I may agree with a lot of people because of open-mindedness and if there is nobody to take charge and 
      be a critical person leading the others I will take the role if it is needed and duty to ensure that we all work with a clear focus.

Online learning style Quiz – (www.educationplanner.org) 
My learning style results are that I am a Tactile learner, I enjoy physical movement and being ‘hands-on’, I need to be active and I talk with my hands. I tend to move around and tinker when I am bored as well as having the 
      need to take things apart to analyse. I am athletic and am appreciative of physical encouragement and my recollection is best understanding things happened not what I saw or heard at the time. I learn best by doing not seeing, 
      hearing or reading. I believe in a group this will cause me to find joy and have more ease in getting to the work that is being created physically. I should take into account that when in a group I will have to understand that the work 
      completed may not have any hands on components and I will have to adjust to that.
</p>
<p>Big five personality test – (www.truity.com)
According to this test it is stated that I have the highest Openness, and this includes being more interested in abstract and creative aspects of life. My lowest area was the ability to work hard in an area as self-disciplined in order to 
      receive a reward later while doing the work now. I am very poor in this aspect as sometimes I lack the motivation to do the things I intend to do, and this results in me not being able to get things done that I know will be 
      beneficial in the future. In relation to a group, I think I will have a good idea of expressing myself and having different ideas, although I may not have as much initiative to complete the tasks at hand, but I do not have any problems 
      with my discipline as it is not the best but I am able to overcome it and I can work hard and do things just as normal.
      </p>
    Project Idea <hr />
    <p>My project idea will be an app or website that allows a user to quickly get onto it and find any car information they need, such as instructions on how to properly change a flat tyre or what tyre pressure a car needs and how often 
      to check it. I am targeting this app towards people of the ages 16-26 who have interest or are people who drive a car. 
My motivation to create this app would be as a result of noticing that less and less people as we progress are aware of basic car maintenance procedures and what to do in emergency situations. This is alarming as I believe if you are 
      going to drive a car you must have a way to ensure you know what to do in common faults a car could have. “Millennials are less likely than older drivers to have read their owner’s manual (50% vs. 60%), according to North Carolina State University 
      researchers.” This provides the notion that as we age, we stray further from car knowledge. As I even have had experiences where I have forgotten the way to do some aspects of emergency car service, I have heard and encountered many more 
      individuals who have had a lot harder times with their automobile. What I have seen is that this is mostly apparent in the younger ages as I rarely come across older people who have no idea what to do when having car trouble, 
      therefore an app would be suited best as it is common within young people to have working smart phones and an app seems like it would have more appeal than a book. 
A description of the app idea “PocketMechanic” will be an app that is targeting young people at the ages of 16-26 is that the app will firstly provide functions to choose from initially as to go through a questionnaire in order to determine 
      the type of car that the app user drives. From this the user will be prompted to the home page which has different icons along the bottom of the screen to click to go from ‘common issues’ to ‘search issue’ and ‘contact us’. 
      This provides the user with the ability to ensure that they can search issues or if they do not know exactly what they are searching for they can go to common issues that will allow them to find the issues that happen most and 
      the solutions, finally if there is no way to find out their problem there is a contact us option where there will be some sort of 24/7 call centre to assist directly with calls. At the initial usage of the app there is also the skip 
      option in which it goes straight to the home menu and instead of having to input your car model into the app you can just go to common issues and it shows common issues with a general advice and explanation that can satisfy the user, 
      but it will not be as in depth as a direct exact car model search will be. It can provide the user with the necessary information, but it will be up to the user to complete it and do a little bit of logical thinking in order to get 
      through the issue. Along with all the car advice techniques there is the ability to get video descriptions that run you through the car problem directly with the exact car model the user has inputted, in addition to this there is a 
      written display with pictures and the final function that will be available with the user when they are on their issue is the contact button. The contact button starts a call directly to the 24/7 call centre in which the car 
      type and issue is already presented towards the staff and they are able to start immediately with assistance. Along with all this there is also the availability to provide the content in different languages with English as the base and subtitles 
      on videos as well as having the call centre able to take calls in various languages that are the most common such as Spanish and Chinese. A main area is that the app must run offline fully, this is as a result of the need to collect information about 
      a car problem when driving and you may not always have internet available, due to this the app will download automatically all the common car problems and solutions once the car model is entered and if allowed it will download the complex and 
      rare ones. As storage is to be watched due to downloading everything there is the ability to just download the written content and the user can opt to download more than that if necessary.

  <p>  Technology and Tools required – </p>
  <ul>    
  <li>- Git</li>
       <li>- Apache NetBeans</li>
       <li>- Atom</li>
       <li>- Cloud servers</li>
  </ul>
  <p> Skills required – </p>
  <ul>  
  <li> - Programming ability</li>
      <li>- Database skill</li>
     <li> - UI/UX ability</li>
     <li> - Cross Platform capability</li>
  </ul> 
    It will be not very hard to get this software information as It is just ability to code and it is not a very hard design of an app. The hard parts may include the fact that with app language change as well as car model change it may cause bugs 
      in ensuring that the whole interface is changed to cater to the specific need that is changed. Although the rest of the skills are able to be learnt or paid for the service.

      Outcome - 
      If the project is successful then it will be revolutionary for the world of private transport, as many more individuals will not have to sit around clueless about what to do when the tyre gets punctured. A person can simply get on 
      their phone and search what to do and follow the videos and written explanation to learn their way back on the road. The problem will be solved by having these young people using apps as that is more common to use technology, this will 
      prompt them to go straight to the app when in need not having to call a friend or wait for roadside assistance. This will cause the roads to run a lot smoother and cause less wear and tear on cars to be overused, as people will be able to 
      complete tasks very efficiently without having cars stopping on the side or other cars requesting help from passers. This will revolutionise the driving world as there will be less holdup for everyone having a complication, the ease of having 
      the info right in the palm of your hand will ensure that any problem is swiftly and promptly fixed without needing others to spend time to help.
